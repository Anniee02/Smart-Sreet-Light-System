# Smart-Sreet-Light-System

In summary, the implementation of smart street lighting systems capable of detecting and classifying different classes of objects can make street lamp systems more economical and improve their longevity. These systems have the potential to transform urban lighting infrastructure and offer more effective, efficient, and sustainable lighting options to communities worldwide.
Due to their potential to increase the effectiveness and sustainability of urban infrastructure, smart city technologies have attracted a growing amount of interest in recent years. The creation of smart street lighting systems, which make use of a variety of sensors and technologies to offer effective and efficient lighting in metropolitan areas, is an important area of attention for smart cities. Most smart street lighting systems include a variety of sensors, including light, motion, and temperature sensors, which enable the system to change the street lights' brightness depending on the amount of ambient light, the presence of people or vehicles on the road, and other environmental factors. Smart street lighting solutions can result in significant energy and cost savings as well as increased comfort and safety for both drivers and pedestrians on the road. These systems are a sustainable option for urban lighting infrastructure since they can reduce carbon emissions and environmental pollutants. Smart city technologies like traffic management, parking, and air quality monitoring systems can all be combined with smart street lighting systems in addition to these advantages.
